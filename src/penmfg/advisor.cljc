  "WritingInstrumentAdvisor -- the *contained intelligence node* for
  the pen/pencil/writing-instrument plant-operations coordination
  actor.

  It normalizes production-batch patches (product-type/
  materials-safety-pass-percent/weight-grams/defect-rate), drafts a
  molding/assembly-equipment maintenance scheduling proposal against a
  piece of equipment, drafts a safety-concern flag, and drafts an
  outbound writing-instrument shipment coordination proposal against a
  production batch. CRITICAL: it is a smart-but-untrusted advisor. It
  returns a *proposal* (with a rationale + the fields it cited), never
  a committed record and NEVER a real molding/assembly-line-equipment
  actuation, freight dispatch, or materials-safety compliance
  certification -- see README `What this actor does NOT do`. Every
  output is censored downstream by `penmfg.governor` before anything
  touches the SSoT.

  Like every sibling actor's advisor, this is a deterministic mock so
  the actor graph runs offline and the governor contract is exercised
  end-to-end. In production this calls a real LLM (kotoba-llm or
  equivalent) with the same proposal shape.

  Proposal shape (all kinds):

  CRITICAL invariant this advisor upholds: every request it is asked to
  route MUST itself carry `:effect :propose` (the request-level
  contract every caller of this actor agrees to) -- `penmfg.governor`
  HARD-holds any request that doesn't, so a mis-wired caller can never
  reach a commit path even if this advisor were compromised."
