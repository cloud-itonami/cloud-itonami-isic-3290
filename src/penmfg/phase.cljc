  "Phase 0->3 staged rollout for the pen/pencil/writing-instrument
  plant-operations coordination actor.

    Phase 0  read-only          -- no writes, still governor-gated.
    Phase 1  assisted-intake    -- production-batch logging allowed,
                                    every write needs human approval.
    Phase 2  assisted-coordinate -- adds safety-concern flags and
                                    shipment-coordination proposals,
                                    still approval.
    Phase 3  supervised-auto    -- adds maintenance scheduling (still
                                    always approval -- see below);
                                    governor-clean, high-confidence
                                    `:log-production-batch` (no
                                    physical/financial risk) may auto-
                                    commit.

  `:schedule-maintenance` is deliberately ABSENT from every phase's
  `:auto` set, including phase 3 -- a permanent structural fact, not a
  rollout milestone still to come. Scheduling real maintenance against
  a piece of equipment is the one act in this domain with physical
  consequence (a molding/assembly-equipment maintenance window means
  production downtime, and the equipment ends up actually touched); it
  is always a human plant supervisor's call. `penmfg.governor`'s
  `actuate-equipment-blocked-violations` HARD-blocks actuate attempts
  unconditionally, and the confidence/high-stakes gate independently
  never lets `:flag-safety-concern` auto-commit either -- multiple
  independent layers agree on where this actor's authority ends. Like
  every prior sibling's phase-3 `:auto` set, this domain has only ONE
  member (`:log-production-batch`) -- no separate no-risk lifecycle
  distinct from ordinary record logging.")
