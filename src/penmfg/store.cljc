(ns penmfg.store
  "SSoT for the pen/pencil/writing-instrument plant-operations
  coordination actor, behind a `Store` protocol so the backend is a
  swap, not a rewrite -- the same seam every `cloud-itonami-isic-*`
  actor in this fleet uses.

  Scope note: like its closest domain analog (`cloud-itonami-isic-
  3240`'s own `toysmfg.store`), this build ships a single `MemStore`
  backend only (atom of EDN) -- the deterministic default for
  dev/tests/demo, no deps. Per docs/adr/0001-architecture.md
  Decision 1, this vertical is self-contained (no external
  pen/pencil/writing-instrument-manufacturing capability library, no
  jurisdiction-scoped Datomic-parity requirement driving a second
  backend); a `langchain.db`-backed store can be added later behind
  the same protocol without changing any caller.

  Four kinds of entity live here:
    - `batches`          -- the central entity. A production batch's
                             product-type/materials-safety-pass-percent/
                             weight-grams/defect-rate record.
                             `:verified?` marks whether the batch's own
                             claims have actually been QC-inspected
                             (never inferred from a routine intake
                             patch); `:registered?` marks whether it
                             is on file in the plant's production
                             ledger; `:shipped-units` tracks the
                             batch's own cumulative-shipped ground
                             truth.
    - `equipment`         -- a molding/assembly unit's own record.
                             `:verified?`/`:registered?` track whether
                             it has actually been inspected/
                             commissioned and is on file -- the same
                             ground-truth discipline as `batches`.
    - `maintenance`       -- a scheduled molding/assembly-equipment
                             maintenance-window DRAFT against a piece
                             of equipment (`penmfg.registry`'s
                             `register-maintenance`). Dedicated
                             `:scheduled?` double-schedule guard (never
                             a `:status` value -- the same discipline
                             every prior governor's guards establish,
                             informed by `cloud-itonami-isic-6492`'s
                             status-lifecycle bug, ADR-2607071320).
    - `shipments`         -- a proposed outbound writing-instrument
                             shipment DRAFT (`penmfg.registry`'s
                             `register-shipment`).

  Plus a generic `records` map (id -> raw record) used only for
  direct, domain-agnostic `commit-record!` calls (a record with no
  `:effect` key) -- the store-level primitive every sibling actor's
  own MemStore exposes underneath its domain-specific commit dispatch.

  The ledger stays append-only: 'which batch was logged, which
  maintenance was scheduled against a verified/registered equipment
  unit, which shipment was coordinated and at what
  independently-recomputed quantity, approved by whom, which safety
  concern was flagged' is always a query over an immutable log -- the
  audit trail a plant owner or downstream buyer trusting this
  coordinator needs."
