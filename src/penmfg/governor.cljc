  "Writing Instrument Plant Operations Governor -- the independent
  compliance layer that earns the WritingInstrumentAdvisor the right
  to commit. The advisor has no notion of whether a piece of equipment
  it wants to schedule maintenance against has actually been
  inspected/registered, whether a batch it wants to coordinate a
  shipment against has actually been QC-verified/registered, whether a
  maintenance proposal secretly tries to ACTUATE (rather than merely
  draft-schedule) molding/assembly-line equipment, whether a proposal
  secretly tries to self-issue a materials-safety compliance
  certification (an authority this actor never holds), whether a
  shipment proposal's own claimed quantity would blow through the
  batch's own logged production quantity, or when an act stops being a
  coordination proposal and becomes direct molding/assembly-line-
  equipment control, so this MUST be a separate system able to
  *reject* a proposal and fall back to HOLD.

  `:itonami.blueprint/governor` is
  `:writing-instrument-plant-operations-governor` (see
  docs/adr/0001-architecture.md).

  Checks below, ALL HARD violations except the confidence/high-stakes
  gate (SOFT -- asks a human to look, and the human may approve):

    1. Request-level propose-only  -- did the CALLER's own request
                                       actually declare `:effect
                                       :propose`? Any other value is a
                                       mis-wired/compromised caller
                                       trying to bypass proposal-only
                                       mode -- HARD, unconditional,
                                       evaluated BEFORE anything else.
    2. Closed op allowlist         -- is `:op` one of the four ops this
                                       actor is authorized to coordinate?
                                       Anything else -- HARD hold.
    3. Closed effect allowlist     -- is the PROPOSAL's own `:effect`
                                       (what would actually commit) one
                                       of the four propose-shaped
                                       effects? A proposal effect
                                       outside this set (e.g. a
                                       hallucinated `:molding-unit/
                                       actuate` or `:assembly-station/
                                       run`) is the 'direct molding/
                                       assembly-line-equipment control'
                                       scope violation this actor must
                                       NEVER perform -- HARD, PERMANENT,
                                       unconditional.
    4. Equipment-actuate blocked   -- for `:schedule-maintenance`, does
                                       the proposal's own `:value`

                                       true`? Directly actuating
                                       molding/assembly-line equipment
                                       is this actor's other permanent
                                       scope boundary (see README `What
                                       this actor does NOT do`) -- HARD,
                                       PERMANENT, unconditional. NO
                                       phase and NO human approval can
                                       ever override this (see
                                       `penmfg.phase`: this op is never
                                       a member of any phase's `:auto`
                                       set either -- two independent
                                       layers agree).
    5. Materials-safety-
       certification-authority
       blocked                     -- ANY proposal (any op) whose own
                                       `:value`/`:patch` declares
                                       `:issue-safety-certification?
                                       true` is attempting to
                                       self-issue a materials-safety
                                       compliance certification (e.g.
                                       the ACMI AP/CL seal under ASTM
                                       D4236) -- an authority
                                       exclusively reserved to the
                                       accredited testing/certification
                                       body, never this actor -- HARD,
                                       PERMANENT, unconditional.
    6. Equipment not verified/
       registered                  -- for `:schedule-maintenance`,
                                       INDEPENDENTLY verify the
                                       referenced equipment's own
                                       `:verified?` AND `:registered?`
                                       are both true (`penmfg.registry/
                                       equipment-ready?`) -- never trust
                                       the advisor's own rationale about
                                       verification/registration
                                       status. Grounded in this
                                       blueprint's own HARD invariant
                                       ('plant/batch record must be
                                       independently verified/
                                       registered before any action'):
                                       maintenance must never be
                                       scheduled against equipment
                                       whose own conditions have not
                                       actually been inspected or
                                       whose registration is not
                                       actually on file.
    7. Already scheduled           -- for `:schedule-maintenance`,
                                       refuses to schedule the SAME
                                       maintenance record twice, off a
                                       dedicated `:scheduled?` fact
                                       (never a `:status` value).
    8. Batch not verified/
       registered                  -- for `:coordinate-shipment`,
                                       INDEPENDENTLY verify the
                                       referenced batch's own
                                       `:verified?` AND `:registered?`
                                       are both true (`penmfg.registry/
                                       batch-ready?`) -- never trust the
                                       advisor's own rationale. Also
                                       part of the 'plant/batch record'
                                       HARD invariant: a batch's own
                                       verified/registered status is as
                                       much a ground-truth fact as an
                                       equipment unit's own.
    9. Shipment quantity exceeded  -- for `:coordinate-shipment`,
                                       INDEPENDENTLY recompute whether
                                       the batch's own recorded
                                       `:shipped-units` plus the
                                       proposal's own claimed `:units`
                                       would exceed the batch's own
                                       recorded `:quantity-units`
                                       (`penmfg.registry/shipment-
                                       quantity-exceeded?`) -- ground
                                       truth from the batch's own
                                       permanent fields, never a
                                       self-reported quantity claim.
   10. Invalid product-type        -- for `:log-production-batch`, if
                                       the patch declares a
