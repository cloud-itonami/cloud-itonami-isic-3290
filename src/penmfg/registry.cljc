  "Pure-function domain logic for the pen/pencil/writing-instrument
  plant-operations coordination actor -- equipment/batch verification,
  shipment-quantity recompute, product-type validation,
  materials-safety-pass-percent plausibility validation, batch-weight
  plausibility validation, defect-rate plausibility validation, and
  draft maintenance-schedule/shipment-coordination record construction.

  Per docs/adr/0001-architecture.md Decision 1: this vertical has NO
  pre-existing `kotoba-lang/penmfg`-style capability library to wrap
  (verified: no such repo exists, and no `pen`/`pencil`/`writing`-named
  manufacturing-capability repo exists in kotoba-lang either, via
  GitHub code/repo search). The domain logic therefore lives here as
  pure functions, re-verified INDEPENDENTLY by `penmfg.governor` -- the
  same 'ground truth, not self-report' discipline every sibling
  actor's own registry establishes (most directly
  `toysmfg.registry` from `cloud-itonami-isic-3240`, this actor's
  closest domain analog -- both are back-office coordination actors
  for a molding/assembly plant with a real consumer-protection
  dimension): never trust a proposal's own self-reported
  quantity/status when the inputs needed to recompute it independently
  are already on record.

  This namespace is pure data + pure functions -- no I/O, no network
  call to any real plant-operations system. It builds the DRAFT record
  a plant coordinator would keep (a scheduled equipment maintenance
  window, a coordinated shipment), not the act of actuating
  molding/assembly/finishing-line equipment or dispatching a real
  freight carrier, and never the act of self-issuing a
  materials-safety compliance certification (this actor NEVER does any
  of those -- see README `What this actor does NOT do`).

  SCOPE: ISIC 3290 (Other manufacturing n.e.c.) is a broad residual
  manufacturing category (e.g. brooms/brushes, umbrellas, buttons,
  pens/pencils, artificial flowers -- distinct from sibling ISIC 3240
  games/toys and ISIC 3220 musical instruments). This build's concrete
  illustration is pen/pencil/writing-instrument manufacturing --
  ballpoint pens, pencils, markers, and fountain pens produced on
  injection-molding/assembly lines. This actor coordinates the
  back-office record-keeping around that plant (production-batch
  logging, maintenance scheduling, safety-concern flagging, shipment
  coordination) -- it never touches the molding/assembly-line
  equipment directly, and it never stands in for the
  materials-safety-certification authority (e.g. the Art & Creative
  Materials Institute's AP/CL seal under ASTM D4236, or an equivalent
  national/regional standard) that certifies a product's compliance
  with an applicable materials-safety standard."
