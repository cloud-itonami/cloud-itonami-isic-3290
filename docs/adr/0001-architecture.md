# ADR-0001: WritingInstrumentAdvisor ⊣ Writing Instrument Plant Operations Governor architecture

## Status

Accepted. `cloud-itonami-isic-3290` promoted from `:spec` to
`:implemented` in the `kotoba-lang/industry` registry, following the
verified fresh-scaffold protocol established by prior actors in this
fleet.

## Context

`cloud-itonami-isic-3290` publishes an OSS blueprint for ISIC 3290
(Other manufacturing n.e.c.) — a broad residual manufacturing category
(e.g. brooms/brushes, umbrellas, buttons, pens/pencils, artificial
flowers) distinct from sibling ISIC 3240 (games and toys, already
`:implemented`) and ISIC 3220 (musical instruments, already
`:implemented`). This build's concrete illustration is
**pen/pencil/writing-instrument manufacturing plant operations
coordination** (production-batch product-type/materials-safety-pass-
percent/weight/defect-rate data logging, injection-molding/assembly-
equipment maintenance scheduling, safety-concern flagging, and
outbound product shipment coordination), documented plainly in the
README as the chosen concrete illustration of this broad n.e.c.
category. Like every actor in this fleet, the blueprint alone is not
an implementation: this ADR records the governed-actor architecture
that promotes it to real, tested code, following the same langgraph
StateGraph + independent Governor + Phase 0->3 rollout pattern
established across the cloud-itonami fleet.

Identity ({:id "3290" :name "Other manufacturing n.e.c."}) was
independently verified against a fresh clone of `kotoba-lang/
industry`'s `resources/kotoba/industry/registry.edn` (fetched via the
GitHub git-data blob API, not the raw.githubusercontent.com CDN)
before any work began, per this fleet's ID/name-mismatch caution
(prior agents in this fleet have mislabeled their assigned ISIC
class). The entry's own `:repo` field pointed at a stale, never-created
`gftdcojp/cloud-itonami-C3290` placeholder; the real `cloud-itonami`
org target name was independently confirmed 404 via `gh api
repos/cloud-itonami/cloud-itonami-isic-3290` before scaffolding began.

The closest domain analog is `cloud-itonami-isic-3240` (Manufacture of
games and toys): both are back-office coordination actors for a fixed
processing PLANT with molding/assembly production equipment and a
real safety/consumer-protection dimension, and both share the same
four-op shape (`:log-production-batch`/`:schedule-maintenance`/
`:flag-safety-concern`/`:coordinate-shipment`) and the same two-entity
verified/registered gate structure (equipment for maintenance
scheduling, batch for shipment coordination). This build mirrors
`cloud-itonami-isic-3240`'s architecture closely but adapts the hazard
profile and equipment/product vocabulary to the writing-instrument
plant: this vertical's central physical hazard is molding/assembly-
equipment operation (the same as 3240), and its central
consumer-protection dimension is materials-safety standard compliance
(ink/pigment/solvent toxicity and labeling testing per ASTM D4236 /
the ACMI AP/CL seal) for ballpoint pens, pencils, markers, and
fountain pens (rather than 3240's toy-safety-standard compliance for
plastic/wooden toys, board games, and puzzles); its permanent
equipment-actuation block guards the same molding/assembly-line
EQUIPMENT vocabulary (`:actuate-equipment?`) as 3240; its
production-batch record declares a `:product-type` (closed set
spanning ballpoint-pen/pencil/marker/fountain-pen, replacing 3240's
plastic-toy/wooden-toy/board-game/puzzle) and a
`:materials-safety-pass-percent` (a compliance-percentage-against-
standard-threshold analog of 3240's safety-test-pass-percent,
plausibility-checked 1-100) and a `:weight-grams` reading
(plausibility-checked above 0 up to the same 1,000,000g/1-tonne
per-batch ceiling, reflecting a very large writing-instrument
production run) in addition to a `:defect-rate-percent`, the same
shape 3240 uses; and its shipment quantity is tracked in
finished-goods-piece UNITS (`:units`/`:quantity-units`/
`:shipped-units`), the same counted-not-weighed shape 3240 uses.

This vertical has a DOMAIN-SPECIFIC permanent block mirroring 3240's
toy-safety-certification block but for the materials-safety
regulatory/attestation regime: manufacture of writing instruments
(particularly markers, and pens/pencils with coated or printed
components) is subject to materials-safety compliance certification
(the compliance mark an accredited testing/certification body applies
to certify a product meets an applicable materials-safety standard,
e.g. the Art & Creative Materials Institute's AP (non-toxic) or CL
(cautionary labeling) seal under ASTM D4236, or an equivalent
national/regional certification regime). This actor is never the
materials-safety-certification authority -- any proposal (regardless
of op) that declares `:issue-safety-certification? true` is a HARD,
PERMANENT, unconditional block
(`penmfg.governor/safety-certification-authority-blocked-violations`),
the same "no phase, no human override" posture as the equipment-
actuation block.

This vertical has NO pre-existing `kotoba-lang/penmfg`-style capability
library to wrap (verified: no such repo exists, and no
`pen`/`pencil`/`writing`-named manufacturing-capability repo exists in
`kotoba-lang` either, via GitHub code/repo search). This build
therefore uses self-contained domain logic -- pure functions in
`penmfg.registry` (equipment/batch verification, shipment-quantity
recompute, product-type validation, materials-safety-pass-percent
plausibility validation, weight-grams plausibility validation,
defect-rate plausibility validation) are re-verified independently by
the governor, the same "ground truth, not self-report" discipline
established across prior actors (most directly `cloud-itonami-isic-
3240`'s `toysmfg.registry`).

This blueprint's own `:itonami.blueprint/governor` keyword,
`:writing-instrument-plant-operations-governor`, is grep-verified
UNIQUE fleet-wide (`gh search code
"writing-instrument-plant-operations-governor" --owner cloud-itonami`,
zero hits before this repo was created).

## Decision

### Decision 1: Self-contained domain logic (no external pen/pencil/writing-instrument-manufacturing capability library to wrap)

Unlike actors that delegate to pre-existing domain libraries, this
writing-instrument-plant vertical has NO pre-existing capability
library to wrap. The equipment/batch-verification / shipment-quantity
/ product-type / materials-safety-pass-percent / weight-grams /
defect-rate validation functions live as pure functions in
`penmfg.registry` and are re-verified independently by
`penmfg.governor` -- the same "ground truth, not self-report"
discipline established across prior actors (most directly
`cloud-itonami-isic-3240`'s `toysmfg.registry`).

### Decision 2: Coordination, not control — scope boundary at the back-office

This actor is **strictly back-office coordination** of
writing-instrument-plant plant operations. It does NOT:
- Control molding or assembly equipment directly
- Make plant-safety or materials-safety-certification decisions (exclusive to the human plant supervisor / accredited testing-and-certification body)
- Actuate molding/assembly-line equipment
- Self-issue a materials-safety compliance certification

All proposals are `:effect :propose` only. The advisor proposes; the
governor validates; escalation paths funnel to human plant-supervisor
approval. This is not a replacement for the supervisor's authority or
the certification body's authority — it is a proposal-screening and
documentation layer.

**CRITICAL SAFETY/CONSUMER-PROTECTION BOUNDARY**: writing-instrument
manufacturing is a safety- and consumer-protection-relevant domain
(molding/assembly-line equipment hazard, ink/pigment/solvent
materials-safety compliance for ballpoint pens, pencils, markers, and
fountain pens). Safety-concern flagging NEVER auto-commits. All safety
concerns escalate immediately to human review.

### Decision 3: Safety-concern escalation — always human sign-off

`:flag-safety-concern` (materials-safety -- ink/pigment toxicity,
solvent exposure -- or equipment-safety concern) ALWAYS escalates,
never auto-commits. This is not a "low-stakes proposal" — it is a
circuit-breaker that must reach human authority.

### Decision 4: Two independent verified/registered gates (equipment AND batch), not one

Like `cloud-itonami-isic-3240`, this vertical has TWO entity kinds
each gating a different op: `:schedule-maintenance` independently
verifies the referenced **equipment** unit's own `:verified?`/
`:registered?` fields; `:coordinate-shipment` independently verifies
the referenced **batch**'s own `:verified?`/`:registered?` fields.
Both are the same "plant/batch record must be independently
verified/registered before any action" HARD invariant applied to the
two distinct record kinds this domain actually has.
`:coordinate-shipment` additionally independently recomputes whether
a batch's own recorded shipped-to-date unit quantity plus the
proposal's own claimed unit quantity would exceed the batch's own
recorded production quantity — never taken on the advisor's
self-report.

### Decision 5: HARD invariants (no override)

Four HARD governor invariants (elaborated into thirteen concrete
checks in `penmfg.governor`, mirroring `cloud-itonami-isic-3240`'s own
elaboration of its HARD invariants into concrete checks, adapted to
this vertical's materials-safety-pass-percent/weight plausibility
fields) block proposals and cannot be overridden by human approval:
1. Plant/batch record (equipment for maintenance, batch for shipment) must be independently verified/registered before any action is taken against it, and a shipment's quantity must independently recompute within the batch's own logged production quantity
2. Proposals must be `:effect :propose` only (never direct equipment control)
3. Direct molding/assembly-line-equipment control, equipment actuation, or self-issued materials-safety compliance certification is permanently blocked
4. The op allowlist is closed — `:log-production-batch`/`:schedule-maintenance`/`:flag-safety-concern`/`:coordinate-shipment` only

## Consequences

(+) Writing-instrument-plant plant operations back-office now has a
documented, governed, auditable coordination layer that funnels all
decisions through independent validation before human approval.

(+) The "coordination, not control" boundary is explicit in code: all
`:effect :propose`, all real-world actuation requires human plant-
supervisor sign-off, and no materials-safety compliance certification
can ever be self-issued.

(+) Scope is bounded and verifiable: four HARD invariants (elaborated
into thirteen concrete governor checks) protect against scope creep
into unauthorized equipment operation, equipment actuation, or
materials-safety-certification self-issuance. Safety concerns are a
circuit-breaker, not a threshold.

(+) Safety-critical discipline is explicit: safety-concern flagging
cannot be rate-limited, suppressed, or auto-decided by phase gate.
Human review is mandatory.

(-) Still a simulation/proposal layer, not a real plant-operations
control system. Equipment actuation, line operation, and
materials-safety certification issuance remain human-/institution-
controlled via external channels.

(-) No integration with real plant-management databases (equipment
telemetry, batch tracking, freight dispatch, certification-body APIs)
— this is a standalone coordinator blueprint.

## Verification

- `cloud-itonami-isic-3290`: `clojure -M:test` green (all tests pass;
  see the superproject ADR and `kotoba-lang/industry` registry entry
  for the exact `Ran N tests containing M assertions, 0 failures, 0
  errors` output, verified from an independent fresh clone), `clojure
  -M:lint` clean, `clojure -M:dev:run` demo narrative exercises
  proposal submission, escalation, and every HARD-hold scenario
  directly (not-propose-effect, unknown-op, equipment-not-verified,
  batch-not-verified, shipment-quantity-exceeded, equipment-actuate-
  blocked, safety-certification-authority-blocked, already-scheduled,
  invalid-product-type, invalid-materials-safety-pass-percent,
  invalid-weight, invalid-defect-rate).
- All source is `.cljc` (portable ClojureScript / JVM / nbb) — no
  JVM-only interop; the actor graph is invoked exclusively via
  `langgraph.graph/run*` (not `.invoke`, which is not cljs-portable).
- Audit ledger is append-only, all decisions are traced; every settled
  request (commit or hold) leaves exactly one ledger fact.
- `deps.edn` pins `io.github.kotoba-lang/langgraph` and
  `io.github.kotoba-lang/langchain` via `:local/root` directly in the
  top-level `:deps` (not only under a `:dev` alias), so a bare
  `clojure -M:test` resolves offline inside the monorepo checkout.
