# cloud-itonami-isic-3290: Other manufacturing n.e.c.

Open Business Blueprint for **ISIC 3290**: other manufacturing n.e.c. — a broad
residual manufacturing category (e.g. brooms/brushes, umbrellas, buttons,
pens/pencils, artificial flowers — distinct from sibling ISIC 3240 games/toys
and ISIC 3220 musical instruments). This build's concrete illustration is
**pen/pencil/writing-instrument manufacturing**: an autonomous "actor" (LLM
advisor behind an independent Governor, langgraph-clj StateGraph, append-only
audit ledger) that coordinates back-office **writing-instrument plant
operations**: production-batch data logging (product-type/
materials-safety-pass-percent/weight/defect-rate), injection-molding/
assembly-equipment maintenance scheduling, safety-concern flagging, and
outbound product shipment coordination.

This repository designs a forkable OSS business for writing-instrument-plant
plant operations: run by a qualified operator so a plant keeps its own
operating records instead of renting a closed SaaS.

## Scope: plant operations coordination, not molding/assembly-line control

ISIC 3290 covers a broad residual set of manufacturing activities not
elsewhere classified. This build's concrete illustration is the
**writing-instrument plant** that injection-molds, assembles, and
QC-tests ballpoint pens, pencils, markers, and fountain pens. This
actor coordinates the back-office record keeping around that plant —
it never touches the molding/assembly-line equipment directly, and it
is never the materials-safety-certification authority (e.g. an
accredited testing/certification body applying the Art & Creative
Materials Institute's AP/CL seal under ASTM D4236 or an equivalent
national/regional standard) that certifies a product's compliance with
an applicable materials-safety standard.

## What this actor does

Proposes **plant operations coordination**, not equipment operation:
- `:log-production-batch` — molding/assembly/QC batch, output-quality data logging (product-type/materials-safety-pass-percent/weight/defect-rate; administrative, not an operational decision)
- `:schedule-maintenance` — molding/assembly-equipment maintenance scheduling proposal
- `:flag-safety-concern` — surface a materials-safety (e.g. ink/pigment toxicity, solvent exposure) or equipment-safety concern (always escalates)
- `:coordinate-shipment` — outbound product shipment coordination proposal

## What this actor does NOT do

**CRITICAL SCOPE BOUNDARY — this is a safety- and consumer-protection-
relevant domain** (molding/assembly-line equipment, ink/pigment/solvent
materials-safety compliance, direct downstream consequence for
consumers of the finished writing instruments):

- Does NOT control molding or assembly equipment directly
- Does NOT make plant-safety or materials-safety-certification decisions (that's the plant supervisor's / accredited testing-and-certification body's exclusive human/institutional authority)
- Does NOT actuate molding/assembly-line equipment (human plant supervisor decides)
- Does NOT self-issue a materials-safety compliance certification (e.g. the ACMI AP/CL seal under ASTM D4236 — the accredited testing/certification body's exclusive authority — a PERMANENT, unconditional block)
- ONLY proposes/coordinates operations back-office; all actuation and materials-safety certification requires explicit human/institutional authority
- Safety-concern flagging ALWAYS escalates — never auto-decided, no confidence threshold or phase below escalation

## Architecture

Classic governed-actor pattern (`penmfg.operation/build`, a langgraph-clj StateGraph):
1. **`penmfg.advisor`** (sealed intelligence node, `WritingInstrumentAdvisor`): proposes decisions only, never commits
2. **`penmfg.governor`** (independent, `Writing Instrument Plant Operations Governor`): validates against domain rules, re-derived from `penmfg.registry`'s pure functions and `penmfg.store`'s SSoT -- never trusts the advisor's own self-report
   - HARD invariants (always `:hold`, no override):
     - Plant/batch record must be independently verified/registered (`:verified?` AND `:registered?`) before any action is taken against it (equipment before maintenance scheduling, batch before shipment coordination)
     - The request's own `:effect` must be `:propose` (never a direct-write bypass)
     - `:op` must be in the closed four-op allowlist
     - The proposal's own `:effect` must be one of the four propose-shaped effects (no direct molding/assembly-line-equipment control)
     - Directly actuating molding/assembly-line equipment (`:actuate-equipment? true`) is a PERMANENT, unconditional block
     - Self-issuing a materials-safety compliance certification (`:issue-safety-certification? true`, any op) is a PERMANENT, unconditional block
     - A shipment may not push a batch's own recorded shipped quantity past its own logged production quantity (independently recomputed)
     - No double-scheduling the same maintenance record
     - No fabricated `:product-type` value on a production-batch patch
     - No physically/certifiably implausible `:materials-safety-pass-percent` value on a production-batch patch
     - No physically implausible `:weight-grams` value on a production-batch patch
     - No physically implausible `:defect-rate-percent` value on a production-batch patch
   - ESCALATE (always human sign-off, overridable by a human):
     - `:flag-safety-concern` always escalates, regardless of confidence
     - Low-confidence proposals
3. **`penmfg.phase`** (Phase 0->3 rollout): `:schedule-maintenance`/`:flag-safety-concern`/`:coordinate-shipment` are NEVER in any phase's `:auto` set (permanent, matching the governor's own posture); only `:log-production-batch` may auto-commit at phase 3 when clean
4. **`penmfg.store`** (append-only audit ledger + SSoT): a single `MemStore` backend behind a `Store` protocol (see ns docstring for why a second Datomic-backed backend is out of scope for this build)

## Development

```bash
# Run tests (top-level deps.edn already pins langgraph+langchain local/root)
clojure -M:test

# Run tests via the workspace :dev override alias (equivalent, kept for sibling-repo parity)
clojure -M:dev:test

# Run the demo
clojure -M:dev:run

# Lint
clojure -M:lint
```

## Status

`:implemented` — `governor.cljc`/`store.cljc`/`advisor.cljc`/`registry.cljc` + `deps.edn` complete the module set; tests green, demo runnable, langgraph-clj integration verified.
